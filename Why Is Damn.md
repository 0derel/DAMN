## Why Am I Obsessed This Manifest?
Because this means that you declare your own freedom. It means you can research, reach and learn what you are looking for, without being dependent on anyone, without waiting for anyone.

Learning is an ongoing action. We have to learn something for life. Think of it as a feature that separates us from a table lamp.

Even the brightness of the table lamp depends on you. If you don't want to depend to someone to shine like a table lamp, you should adopt this manifest.

## Learning to Learn
I am a student too, I first announced this manifesto for myself. "Learning to learn" is the biggest step we can take. We cannot proceed from constantly asking the same questions, including me. **Let's change this shit together**.

## Where Should I Start?
You have already started the moment you were born. You don't need to think about where should I start again. If you are on the road, you are on the right route, if you have learned to go at the right speed, you will get where you want.

I think the best answer to the question where should I start, **read DAMN Manifest**.
